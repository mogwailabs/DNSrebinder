# DNSrebinder

DNSrebinder is a minimal DNS server that can be used to test/verify DNS rebinding vulnerabilities. It is based on the Python DNS library [dnslib](https://github.com/paulc/dnslib). DNSrebinder allows you to define various settings on the command line, including the number of requests before the actual rebinding should occur.

## Installation

The recommended way is to use a Python virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

On systems that are using systemd, you need to temporary disable systemd-resolved as this service listen on port 53:

```
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```
To re-enable it

```
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved
```

Please make sure that you have a DNS-NS record that points to the system that is running DNSrebinder.


## Usage

Example usage:
```bash
$ python3 dnsrebinder.py --domain rebind.mydomain.eu. --rebind 127.0.0.1 --ip 8.8.8.8 --counter 2
...
```

This starts a DNS server on port 53 listening on UDP and TCP. The first two(--counter 2) requests will be answered with 8.8.8.8. Every request after that will be answered with the rebind address 127.0.0.1 (--rebind 127.0.0.1).

Options overview:
```bash
$ python3 dnsrebinder.py -h
usage: dnsrebinder.py [-h] [--port PORT] [--tcp] [--udp] [--domain DOMAIN]
                     [--ttl TTL] [--ip IP] [--rebind REBIND]
                     [--counter COUNTER]

Start a DNS implemented in Python. Usually DNSs use UDP on port 53.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --port PORT        The port to listen on.
  --tcp              Listen to TCP connections.
  --udp              Listen to UDP datagrams.
  --domain DOMAIN    The domain to listen for
  --ttl TTL          TTL value of DNS responses
  --bind             IP Adress for server to listen on
  --ip IP            IP Adress used to respond
  --rebind REBIND    IP address for rebind
  --counter COUNTER  Number of requests before rebinding
```
